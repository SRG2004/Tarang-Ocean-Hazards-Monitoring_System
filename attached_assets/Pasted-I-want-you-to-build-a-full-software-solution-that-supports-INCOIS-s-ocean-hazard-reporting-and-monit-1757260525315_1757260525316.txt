I want you to build a full software solution that supports INCOIS's ocean hazard reporting and monitoring system exactly as described below. The goal is a fully working mobile and web platform, deployed and production-ready, with all specifications implemented.

Please first carefully review the existing code files I am providing. Identify and fix any errors or gaps in those files. Use them as the foundation to complete the entire project as per the detailed requirements below.

Problem Statement
India’s vast coastline is vulnerable to ocean hazards such as tsunamis, storm surges, high waves, coastal currents, and abnormal sea behavior. INCOIS currently provides early warnings but lacks real-time field reporting from citizens and social media data integration.

Requirements
Unified Reporting Platform (Mobile + Web)

User registration and login with Firebase Authentication.

Role-based access control: Citizens, Volunteers, Officials, Analysts.

Citizens can submit geotagged reports with photos/videos for ocean hazards (e.g., unusual tides, flooding, tsunami, swell surges, high waves).

Volunteers and Officials can manage resources and monitor reports.

Enable offline report data collection with sync capabilities later for remote areas.

Dashboard & Visualization

Interactive map showing live crowdsourced hazard reports with dynamic hotspot generation based on report density.

Visualize social media trends and sentiment extracted via API integrations from Twitter, public Facebook posts, and YouTube comments using NLP/text classification models.

Filters for location, event type, date, and data source for situational awareness.

Real-time updates and alerts for officials and volunteers.

Backend & APIs

Robust backend database using Firestore or Firebase Realtime Database to manage reports, user roles, media uploads, and metadata.

RESTful APIs supporting social media feed ingestion with NLP to extract hazard-relevant information and trends.

Donation management system integrated into the platform for funding and resource allocation.

Volunteer and resource management features (task assignments, availability tracking).

Technology & Deployment

Mobile app built with React Native, fully working on Android (APK included).

Web app developed with React.js for desktop use.

Firebase integration for Authentication, Firestore, and cloud storage for media.

API integration for social media platforms using their official APIs.

Multilingual support (include at least English and regional languages).

Deployment scripts and CI/CD for web and mobile app stores.

Deliverables
Fully functional, production-ready mobile and web apps.

Source code with detailed documentation.

APK file for Android app deployment.

Deployment completed on Firebase (or recommended cloud service) with instructions.

User manuals and admin guides.

Testing scripts and test reports.

Please use my existing code files as the starting point, fix any errors, and fully complete the project end-to-end including deployment and documentation. Ensure the solution meets all requirements and is scalable, secure, and user-friendly for coastal community citizens and disaster management authorities
